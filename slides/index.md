- enroll by:
  - creating a github account if needed
  - cloning the repository
  - making a PR on students.md
- join on [Zulip](econforge.zulipchat.org)
  - we'll communicate in the `computational_seminar` room
  - goes on between the sessions...
- my email: `pwinant@escp.eu`
- any way I can help about your PhD? Don't hesitate to get in touch

### Evaluation

- No exam (we're grown-ups)
- (light) Homework between the sessions
- Participate:
  - make a presentation
  - complete a small "computational" project
- Workgroup encouraged
- The ultimate goal would be to transform this seminar into a "special interest group"

## Computations?

----

### Environment

We will need:
- Git Bash
- VSCode
- Anaconda Python or Miniconda

---

## Operating system, Linux, the Console



### Linux

- Unix-machines are __ubiquitous__ !
  - Linux
  - MacOS X
  - Android
  - even Windows (WSL)
- powers many instances in the cloud

----

### The console

- "The Console" aka "The Terminal"
- A shell to interact with the operating system
  - explore filesystem
  - launch progams
  - more complicated tasks (with scripts)
- Two main flavours
  - Windows: DOS -> Powershell
  - UNIX: Bash, zsh
- Again: bash/zsh are everywhere !
  - macOS, windows (git bash), matlab (!)

----

### Cloud computing

- many "servers" are in the cloud
- an instance is a "virtual computer" running an OS
  - virtualization technologies
- many instances run on one or several computers
- advantage: they can be created/destroyed easily (scalability)
- how do you compute an instance in the cloud?
  - with a graphical connection (VNC, RDesktop)
  - with a terminal
  - or a webapp
- there are instance providers (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud)...
  - ... but often you don't realize they are created

## Editing Environment

### VSCode
